# RPL

This project is just a small hobby to learn and understand how programming languages work.

Don't expect this to be anything interesthing.

Features:
- Placing numbers in registers
- Basic math operations
- Jmp operations

That's it right now I'm currently following a tutorial so more features will come in the future!
