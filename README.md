# Thasm

This project is just a small hobby to learn and understand how programming languages work.

Don't expect this to be anything interesthing.

Features:
- Placing numbers in registers
- Basic math operations
- Jump operations

That's it right now I'm currently following a tutorial so more features will come in the future!

Ps: Info about how to write and use thasm will be written soon.
